<h1><b><b>/FREE_AND_OPEN_SOURCE_SOFTWARE/</b></b></h1>

<h2><b>Introduction</b></h2>

<br>

[Free and Open Source Software (FOSS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software) represents a collaborative approach to software development where the source code is freely available for anyone to view, modify, and distribute.
Unlike proprietary software, FOSS empowers users to take control of their software, fostering transparency, innovation, and community-driven improvements.

<h2><b>History of FOSS</b></h2>

<br>

The roots of FOSS can be traced back to the early days of computing when software was freely shared among researchers and developers.
However, in the 1970s and 1980s, the rise of proprietary software led to a shift where source code became closed and restricted.

In 1983, Richard Stallman launched the GNU Project, laying the foundation for free software principles.
Shortly after, the Free Software Foundation (FSF) was established, promoting the concept of software freedom.
The term "open source" was later popularized in 1998 to emphasize the collaborative and practical benefits of making source code accessible.
Projects like Linux, Apache, and Mozilla Firefox became iconic examples of successful FOSS initiatives, demonstrating the power of community-driven development.

Today, FOSS is a cornerstone of the tech industry, powering everything from individual projects to large-scale enterprise systems.
