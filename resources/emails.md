<h1><b><b>Email (Electronic Mail)</b></b></h1>
> <i>We all have one, and for some... more than one.</i>

<br>

Email, short for "electronic mail", is one of the oldest and most widely used forms of digital communication.
It was first developed in the early 1970s, enabling users to send messages over [**ARPANET**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARPANET), the precursor to
the modern internet. Over there decades, email has evolved into a global communication tool, essential for personal, professional, and marketing purposes.

While email is incredibly convenient, it also raises significant privacy concerns. Email messages can be intercepted, tracked, or harvested by third parties for
advertising, surveillance, or malicious purposes. From spam and phishing to metadata collection and data breaches, email privacy is a growing concern in today's
interconnected world.

Protecting your email privacy involves using secure email providers, enabling encryption, and adopting safe email practices
to ensure your messages and personal data remain confidential.

Now, here are some examples of the same providers being breached, failing to protect your information, or used your information for their own gain.

<h2>Gmail</h2>

* It was revealed that Google scanned users' emails to deliver targeted advertisements, leading to [lawsuits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gmail#Lawsuits) and debates over user privacy.
Google argued that users should have no "reasonable expactation" of email privacy when using the service.

<h2>Outlook</h2>

* In 2013, documents leaked by Edward Snowden revealed that Microsoft was among several companies participating in the [NSA's PRISM program](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PRISM).
* [Microsoft](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jul/11/microsoft-nsa-collaboration-user-data) worked with the NSA to build a backdoor into Outlook.com, allowing the agency to intercept and read web chats on the platform.

<h2>Yahoo! Mail</h2>

* Between [2013](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yahoo_data_breaches#August_2013:_breach) and [2014](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yahoo_data_breaches#Late_2014:_breach), Yahoo experienced data breaches affecting all 3 billion user accounts. These breaches compromised user information,
including email addresses, encrypted passwords, and security questions.

<h2>iCloud Mail</h2>

* In 2013, documents leaked by Edward Snowden revealed that Apple was among several companies participating in the [NSA's PRISM program](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PRISM), 
which allowed the government to access user data, including emails, stored on iCloud. Apple denied knowledge of the program.

<h2>AOL</h2>

* Since AOL's acquisition by [Verizon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verizon#Privacy) Media in 2017, AOL Mail users are subject to data analysis practices
outlined in Verizon's privacy policy. This policy states that Verizon Media analyzes and stores all communications content, including email content from incoming
and outgoing mail, to deliver personalized features, content, and advertising, and services.
