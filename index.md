> My name is **003c717e-69aa-45cf-a9ed-67f45b6c76de**. Welcome to the onboarding process for **Amplivum**.

You may notice that I haven't shared my ***real name*** but instead provided what looks like a random string of characters.
This string is a [**UUID**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universally_unique_identifier), which stands for **Universally Unique Identifier**.
While not absolutely unique in a mathematical sense, the probability of two identical UUIDs is so infinitesimally small&mdash;*yes, that's a word*&mdash;that it's considered practically unique.
Just like a UUID, I am a human being who is not perfect.

All information on this site reflects my personal opinions and research. I strive for accuracy, but if you find any errors or misinformation, please don't hesitate to

> <i>Taking steps to improve your privacy today can stop further data collection. You might not erase the past, but you can prevent more from adding to the pile.</i>

As time marches forward, the value of your older data diminishes. Prevent newer data from being openly shared with others.

By reducing the amount of data you share in the digital world, you can significantly enhance your digital security:
* Better protection against data leaks.
* Easier recovery from data that has already been leaked.

Additionally, take greater control over how your data is shared and who has access to your information.
