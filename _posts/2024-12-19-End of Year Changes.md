Hello there,

As the year draws to a close, I take the time to review my current OpSec practices, assess what went wrong during the year, and implement improvements for the year ahead.

Over the past two weeks, I deployed a new measure aimed at enhancing my OpSec for the upcoming year. 

My hope is to soon create detailed instructions that the average user can follow to implement similar measures themselves.
