<h1><b><b>IDENTIFY</b></b></h1>
> Identify... Identify what?

<br>

To address any problem, you first need to clearly **identify the issue you want to resolve**.
If you don't know what you're trying to fix, finding the right solution becomes **nearly impossible**.

Here are some examples of common issues you might face:
* Reducing unwanted email spam and phishing attempts.
* Preventing the creation of a digital profile about you by others.
* Securing your online accounts and personal information from unauthorized access.
* Protecting your location data and preventing tracking.
* Safeguarding against identity theft and ensuring the security of your financial information.

By identifying your particular issue, you can take the first critical step toward finding effective solutions.
